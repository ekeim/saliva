This is a text file outlining the computational pipeline as it should be 
for QIIME

0.Validate mapping file
1.Demutiplex and quality filter reads
2.pick OTUs based on sequence similarity within reads
3.Pick a representative sequence for each OTU
4. Align taxonomy to OTU representative sequences
5.Filter the alignment
_____________________________________
6. Build a phylogenetic tree
7. Make the OTU table
8. Summarize OTU table
9.Summarize communities by taxonomic composition
10. make taxonomy heatmap
11. compute alpha diversity and generate alpha rarefaction plots
